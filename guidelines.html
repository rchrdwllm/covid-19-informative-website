                <h1>Facts about COVID-19</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is safer to frequently clean your hands and not wear gloves.</li>
                    <li>Vitamin and mineral supplements cannot cure COVID-19.</li>
                    <li>Water or swimming does not transmit the COVID-19 virus.</li>
                    <li>The likelihood of shoes spreading COVID-19 is very low</li>
                    <li>
                        The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by a virus, NOT by bacteria. Antibiotics do not
                        work against viruses.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The prolonged use of medical masks when properly worn, DOES NOT cause CO2 intoxication nor
                        oxygen deficiency.
                    </li>
                    <li>Drinking alcohol does not protect you against COVID-19 and can be dangerous.</li>
                    <li>People of all ages can be infected by the COVID-19 virus</li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Quarantine</b> - separates and restricts the movement of people who were exposed to a
                        contagious disease to see if they become sick.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Isolation</b> - separates sick people with a contagious disease from people who are not sick.
