                    <li>It is safer to frequently clean your hands and not wear gloves.</li>
                    <li>Vitamin and mineral supplements cannot cure COVID-19.</li>

                    <li>The likelihood of shoes spreading COVID-19 is very low</li>
                    <li>
                        The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by a virus, NOT by bacteria. Antibiotics do not
                        work against viruses.

                    <li>
                        The prolonged use of medical masks when properly worn, DOES NOT cause CO2 intoxication nor
                        oxygen deficiency.
                    </li>
                    <li>Drinking alcohol does not protect you against COVID-19 and can be dangerous.</li>
                    <li>People of all ages can be infected by the COVID-19 virus</li>
                    <li>

                                    COVID-19 is transmitted from person to person via droplets, contact, and fomites. It
                                    is transmitted when one individual talks, sneezes, or coughs producing âdropletsâ of
                                    saliva containing the COVID-19 virus. These droplets are then inhaled by another
                                    person. COVID-19 transmission usually occurs among close contacts -- including
                                    family members and healthcare workers. It is therefore important to maintain a
                                    distance of more than 1 meter away from any person who has respiratory symptoms.

                                    According to WHO, there is no confirmed timeline how long a COVID-19 virus survives
                                    in surfaces. However, most likely it behaves like other coronaviruses. Studies show
                                    that coronaviruses can survive on surfaces for a few hours up to several days
                                    depending on varied conditions (e.g. type of surface, temperature or humidity of the
                                    environment). If you suspect that a surface is infected, clean it with disinfectant;
                                    clean your hands with alcohol-based hand sanitizer or wash them with soap and water;
                                    and if possible, minimize touching your eyes, mouth or nose.

                                    The risk of getting COVID-19 from a person without any signs and symptoms is very
                                    low. Remember, COVID-19 is only spread through respiratory droplets coughed by an
                                    infected person. Therefore, if an infected person does not cough, he/she most likely
                                    will not infect others. However, many infected persons only experience mild
                                    symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is
                                    therefore possible to get COVID-19 from an infected person with mild cough but is
                                    not feeling ill.

                                    COVID-19 could be fatal, but this happens rarely. According to WHO, 82% of infected
                                    patients will have mild presentations, 15% will have severe manifestations, and only
                                    3% will be critical. As mentioned before, older people, people with compromised
                                    immune systems, and people with pre-existing medical conditions, such as diabetes
                                    and heart disease, are more prone to fall severely ill with the virus. Around 2% of
                                    people infected with the disease have died.

                                What is the FDA process for a COVID-19 vaccine authorized for emergency use versus an
                                FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccine?
                                <ion-icon name="caret-down-outline"></ion-icon>

                                    Emergency use authorizations (EUAs) can be used by the FDA during public health
                                    emergencies to provide access to unapproved vaccines (or unapproved uses of an
                                    approved vaccine) that may be effective in preventing a disease. Emergency use
                                    authorization is a tool that the FDA can use in a declared public health emergency,
                                    like the current pandemic, to more rapidly make available potentially life-saving
                                    products under very specific conditions. In determining whether to issue an EUA for
                                    a vaccine, after the FDA receives a request for an EUA, the agency evaluates the
                                    data submitted, conducts its own analyses and assesses any known or potential risks
                                    and any known or potential benefits.
                                </p>

                                    For the COVID-19 vaccines that the FDA has authorized for emergency use, the agency
                                    evaluated data submitted by the manufacturers about the vaccineâs safety and
                                    effectiveness, conducted its own analyses of the data, and determined that the
                                    vaccine has met the statutory criteria for issuance of an EUA.
                                </p>

                                    A vaccine that the FDA approved for use in the U.S. has undergone the agencyâs
                                    standard scientific and regulatory evaluation processes.
